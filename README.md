# About the project

SCIC is a special secret group for the Programming hero students who can complete their course on time and fulfil some criteria declared by the Programming Hero authorities. 
I decided to create an web app that will take assignment marks and some additional information from the user and tell the user if he is eligible for the SCIC. 
In this app- 
* The user will input a number between 1 and 12 and more few forms will appear based on the input number.
* The user will input his marks he got from the examiners and full mark of the project based on the deadline in the input fields. 
* The app will show a message about his success or failure. 
* The codes' logics and calculation are based on the criteria for SCIC batch no. 5 only.
